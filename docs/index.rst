absscpi
=======

The **absscpi** library provides a fully-featured Python driver for the Bloomy
Controls ABS over TCP, UDP, RS-485, and UDP multicast. This library is a wrapper
around the `native C/C++ SCPI driver <native_>`_ for the ABS to avoid
unnecessary Python performance overhead.

.. TODO add an example (just include one from an example file)
